# Risk Manager: AI-Driven Risk Management for DeFi

Risk Manager is an AI-driven agent designed to enhance risk management in decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions. This project aims to identify, assess, and mitigate various types of risks, including market volatility, liquidity risks, and compliance issues, through advanced machine learning models and real-time data integration.

## Features

- **Risk Identification**: Automatically identifies potential risks in DeFi transactions using machine learning techniques.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Employs models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict market trends and identify risky scenarios.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Leverages One-Class SVM and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for detecting unusual transaction patterns.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with DeFi protocols via custom APIs to provide real-time risk assessments.
- **Automated Mitigation Strategies**: Implements automated actions such as portfolio rebalancing and transaction halts under high-risk conditions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously updates with new data, models, and user feedback to adapt to evolving market conditions.

## Getting Started


## Roadmap

1. Expand data sources to cover more DeFi protocols.
2. Incorporate advanced neural network models for deeper market sentiment analysis.
3. Develop a more robust user feedback system to fine-tune model parameters.
4. Enhance security features to meet latest compliance standards.
